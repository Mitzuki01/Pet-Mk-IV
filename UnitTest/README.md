## Unit Test Folder
This is a folder where I save various unit test programs/scripts...
Naming convetions:
* "**arduino_\***..." - MCU (Arduino Uno/Nano) low level test of sensors/actuators.
* "**RPi_\***..." - SBC (Raspberry Pi running Raspian) low level test of sensors/actuators and other peripheral components connected to the SBC.
